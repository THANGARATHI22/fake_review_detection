# 🛍️ Fake Review Detection in E-Commerce

This project focuses on detecting fake product reviews on e-commerce platforms using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models.

## 📌 Overview

Fake reviews can mislead buyers and damage the reputation of online platforms. This notebook implements a machine learning pipeline to classify reviews as genuine or fake using traditional NLP methods and models like SVM and Logistic Regression.

## 🔍 Key Features
- Text preprocessing including:
  - Tokenization
  - Stopword removal
  - Lemmatization
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization
- Model training using:
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Logistic Regression
- Performance evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- NLTK 
- pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

## 📊 Model Results
- **SVM with TF-IDF:** 90% accuracy
- **Logistic Regression with TF-IDF:** 88% accuracy
## 📈 Future Enhancements
- Experiment with deep learning or BERT embedding
- Apply to cross-domain datasets (multiple product categories)
- Integration into web platforms for real-time analysis

##  Run the cells in sequence to execute the pipeline
